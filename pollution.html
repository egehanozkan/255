      <h2 class="polType">Air Pollution</h2>
      <p>
        Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by
        any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural
        characteristics of the atmosphere. Household combustion devices, motor
        vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of
        air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include
        particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur
        dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other
        diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality. WHO data
        show that almost all of the global population (99%) breathe air that
        exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants,
        with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest
        exposures. Air quality is closely linked to the earth’s climate and
        ecosystems globally. Many of the drivers of air pollution (i.e.
        combustion of fossil fuels) are also sources of greenhouse gas
        emissions. Policies to reduce air pollution, therefore, offer a win-win
        strategy for both climate and health, lowering the burden of disease
        attributable to air pollution, as well as contributing to the near- and
        long-term mitigation of climate change.

        From smog hanging over cities to smoke inside the home, air pollution
        poses a major threat to health and climate. Ambient (outdoor) air
        pollution in both cities and rural areas is causing fine particulate
        matter which result in strokes, heart diseases, lung cancer, acute and
        chronic respiratory diseases. Additionally, around 2.4 billion people
        are exposed to dangerous levels of household air pollution, while using
        polluting open fires or simple stoves for cooking fuelled by kerosene,
        biomass (wood, animal dung and crop waste) and coal. The combined
        effects of ambient air pollution and household air pollution is
        associated with 7 million premature deaths annually. Sources of air
        pollution are multiple and context specific. The major outdoor pollution
        sources include residential energy for cooking and heating, vehicles,
        power generation, agriculture/waste incineration, and industry. Policies
        and investments that support sustainable land use, cleaner household
        energy and transport, energy-efficient housing, power generation,
        industry, and better municipal waste management can effectively reduce
        key sources of ambient air pollution.

      <h2 class="polType">Water Pollution</h2>
      <p>
        Water pollution (or aquatic pollution) is the contamination of water
        bodies, usually as a result of human activities, so that it negatively
        affects its uses. Water bodies include lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers,
        reservoirs and groundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants
        mix with these water bodies. Contaminants can come from one of four main
        sources: sewage discharges, industrial activities, agricultural
        activities, and urban runoff including stormwater. Water pollution is
        either surface water pollution or groundwater pollution. This form of
        pollution can lead to many problems, such as the degradation of aquatic
        ecosystems or spreading water-borne diseases when people use polluted
        water for drinking or irrigation. Another problem is that water
        pollution reduces the ecosystem services (such as providing drinking
        water) that the water resource would otherwise provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sources of water pollution are either point sources or non-point
        sources. Point sources have one identifiable cause, such as a storm
        drain, a wastewater treatment plant or an oil spill. Non-point sources
        are more diffuse, such as agricultural runoff. Pollution is the result
        of the cumulative effect over time. Pollution may take the form of toxic
        substances (e.g., oil, metals, plastics, pesticides, persistent organic
        pollutants, industrial waste products), stressful conditions (e.g.,
        changes of pH, hypoxia or anoxia, increased temperatures, excessive
        turbidity, changes of salinity), or the introduction of pathogenic
        organisms. Contaminants may include organic and inorganic substances. A
        common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by
        power plants and industrial manufacturers.

      <h2 class="polType">Land Pollution</h2>
      <p>
        Land pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural
        environment that cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form of
        any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as radioactivity,
        heat, sound, or light). Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be
        either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants.
        Although environmental pollution can be caused by natural events, the
        word pollution generally implies that the contaminants have an
        anthropogenic source that is, a source created by human activities, such
        as manufacturing, extractive industries, poor waste management,
        transportation or agriculture. Pollution is often classed as point
        source (coming from a highly concentrated specific site, such as a
        factory or mine) or nonpoint source pollution (coming from a widespread
        distributed sources, such as microplastics or agricultural runoff). Many
        sources of pollution were unregulated parts of industrialization during
        the 19th and 20th centuries until the emergence of environmental
        regulation and pollution policy in the later half of the 20th century.
        Sites where historically polluting industries released persistent
        pollutants may have legacy pollution long after the source of the
        pollution is stopped. Major forms of pollution include air pollution,
        light pollution, litter, noise pollution, plastic pollution, soil
        contamination, radioactive contamination, thermal pollution, visual
        pollution, and water pollution.

        Pollution has widespread consequence on human and environmental health,
        having systematic impact on social and economic systems. In 2015,
        pollution killed nine million people worldwide (one in six
        deaths). Air pollution accounted for 3/4 of these earlier
        deaths. A 2022 literature survey found that levels of
        anthropogenic chemical pollution have exceeded planetary boundaries and
        now threaten entire ecosystems around the world. Pollutants
        frequently have outsized impacts on vulnerable populations, such as
        children and the elderly, and marginalized communities, because
        polluting industries and toxic waste sites tend to be collocated with
        populations with less economic and political power.[8] This outsized
        impact is a core reason for the formation of the environmental justice
        movement, and continues to be a core element of environmental
        conflicts, particularly in the Global South. Because of the impacts of
        these chemicals, local, country and international policy have
        increasingly sought to regulate pollutants, resulting in increasing air
        and water quality standards, alongside regulation of specific waste
        streams. Regional and national policy is typically supervised by
        environmental agencies or ministries, while international efforts are
        coordinated by the UN Environmental Program and other treaty bodies.
        Pollution mitigation is an important part of all of the Sustainable
        Development Goals.
